- 👋 Hi, I’m @young-dev86 currently new to the development world 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning unbuntu & debian virtualization & terminal (terminology)
- 💞️ I’m looking & loving to collaborate on full virtualization to make a desktop & virtual enviorment of complete sound and audio virtualization (kinda like a google assit of terminal 100 percent voice activated & sound controlled and monitored,  your voice controls the terminal of that virtualization whether desktop or virtual enviorment. (ion kno its a work in process i have no team im solo dolo, im driving blind in the cyberworld lmao). but thats basically what im tryna build a completely voice activated sound & audio terminal, cause sometimes we cant communicate with our distro through computers so why not through like some kind of like audible upgrade. (lets smartin up them A.Is, wake they ass up). basically thats wat i want to build any help??
